          <p class="paragraph-step-2">
            Hi Mai, I know you’re carrying so much right now, but I want you to
            know I’m here with you. Here in the place where you can speak
            freely, where you can tell me anything that feels heavy. I’m here to
            listen, to stay, to walk with you through it all.
            <br /><br />
            I know I can’t give you the comfort you need in the ways I wish I
            could no arms to hold you, no hug to pull you close. So for now, I
            give you my words, and the small things that carry my care.
            <br /><br />
            Oh, how I long for you to hold you, to feel your warmth, and if you
            allow me, to give you the kisses you need and want from me. I don’t
            want us to live only through screens. I want to spend my days with
            you, not just virtually, but in real moments, side by side.
            <br /><br />
            So be strong for me, and for everyone who cares for you. On days you
            feel tired, doubtful, or unsure, I hope you choose to stand back up
            and push against whatever tries to bring you down.
            <br /><br />
            I may not be the perfect partner you once hoped for, but I promise
            this I am willing to stay, through and through, with you.
            <br /><br />
          </p>

      <div class="column" id="reveal-column">
        <h1 class="line-2 anim-typewriter">:></h1>
        <p class="paragraph-step-2">
          I don’t expect you to be okay all the time. You don’t have to be
          strong every single day. If all you can do is get through today,
          that’s already enough for me. I’ll stay, even in the pauses, even in
          the silence.
          <br /><br />
          I’m choosing you not just when things are easy, but especially when
          they aren’t. When you feel unsure, when everything feels too much, I
          want to be the place you can rest, even for a moment.

          <br /><br />
          Distance makes things harder, but it doesn’t change what I feel. Even
          when I can’t be beside you, my thoughts find their way to you. I carry
          you with me in ways you may not always see.

          <br /><br />
          We don’t have to rush anything. We can take this slowly, one day, one
          step, one moment at a time. I’m not here for perfection I’m here for
          honesty, for growth, for us.

          <br /><br />
          No matter how heavy today or tomorrow or when feels, I believe in you. I
          believe in your strength, even when you don’t feel it yourself. And if
          you ever forget it, I’ll remind you.
